## 详细说明

This cmdlet is now deprecated, please use Group-BrokerMachine.

Filters desktops using the specified criteria, then groups and counts matching desktops with the same value for a particular property. The number of desktops in the group, and the property value for the group, is output. 例如：

C:\PS> Group-BrokerDesktop -Property SummaryState

Filtering supports the same options as the Get-BrokerDesktop cmdlet, and allows filtering on both desktop and session properties.

Group-BrokerDesktop is similar to the standard PowerShell Group-Object, but is faster than piping the output of Get-BrokerDesktop into Group-Object when working with many desktops.

Note that all session information properties for multi-session desktops is always $null, this means that is is not possible to group these desktops by session information using this command. Use Get-BrokerSession to get information on all current sessions.

Also note that the MaxRecordCount, ReturnTotalRecordCount, Skip, and SortBy parameters apply to GroupInfo records output rather than the filtered desktops.
