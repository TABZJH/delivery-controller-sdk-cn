| SettlementPeriodBeforeAutoShutdown    | Time after a session ends during which automatic shutdown requests (for example, shutdown after use, idle pool management) are deferred. Any outstanding shutdown request takes effect after the settlement period expires.

| SettlementPeriodBeforeUse             | Idle period before a machine can be selected to host a new session after registration or the end of a previous session.
