## 详细说明

Filters sessions using the specified criteria, then groups and counts matching sessions with the same value for a particular property. The number of sessions in the group, and the property value for the group, is output. 例如：

C:\PS> Group-BrokerSession -Property SessionState

Count Name

Filtering supports the same options as the Get-BrokerSession cmdlet, and allows filtering on both machine and session properties.

Group-BrokerSession is similar to the standard PowerShell Group-Object, but is faster than piping the output of Get-BrokerSession into Group-Object when working with many machines.

Note that the MaxRecordCount, ReturnTotalRecordCount, Skip, and SortBy parameters apply to GroupInfo records output rather than the filtered sessions.
